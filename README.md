# Collection of codes for LSMO 
## to be used in AiiDA

Read the description in setup/xxx.code for the origin of each program. 

*NOTE: the use of ./raspa_deneb is deprecated, I keep it for consistency but I splitted the libraries in ./lib and the data files in aiida-database/data/raspa/share/raspa*
